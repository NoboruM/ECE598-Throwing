# OpTaS Examples and Experiments

Several examples are contained in this directory.
In addition, two experiments are also included.

The majority of these examples require [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/).
If you installed OpTaS without modifying `setup.py` this should have been installed by default.
Otherwise, you can install PyBullet using `$ pip install pybullet`.

Note, the OpTaS visualizer requires [VTK](https://vtk.org/).
If you installed OpTaS without modifying `setup.py` this should have been installed by default.
Otherwise, you can install VTK using `$ pip install vtk`.

## Examples

### Position IK

The `example.py` script showcases some of the main features of OpTaS.

### Figure of Eight Planning

This script, `figure_eight_plan.py`, demonstrates how to implement a simple planner.
A hand-crafted task space trajectory is given, and the planner finds the joint space trajectory.

### Dual Arm

The script that runs the dual arm example is `dual_arm.py`.
The goal of this example is to demonstrate how multiple robots can be incorporated into a single optimization formulation.

A task space trajectory is hand crafted, for a dual arm setup using two KUKA robot arms.
A joint space plan is computed for both arms by solving an optimization problem in a single formulation.

### Visualization

This is a simple example that shows how to pass the robot model to the visualizer.
The script that implements this example is `visualization.py`.

### MPC

A basic task space MPC controller is demonstrated in the `point_mass_mpc.py` script.
The script implements a basic MPC controller, and plots the solution in a short animation.

The demonstration first computes a task space plan.
Then the robot (point mass) is tasked with tracking the plan whilst adapting to dynamic obstacles in the scene.
An obstacle, at execution time, is given some motion that impedes the plan - the goal of the MPC is to avoid the obstacle.
This is achieved via the MPC controller.

### Point Mass Planning

This example, in the script `point_mass_planner.py`, demonstrates how to plan a trajectory using a task model.

### Planar IK

The `planar_ik.py` script contains a simple example of a possible full Inverse Kinematics (IK) implementation for a planar three Degrees of Freedom (DoF) robot arm.
The task-space consists of the x and y position of the end-effector and the IK computes an optimal set of joint angles, using a non-linear program formulation through the CassADiSolver and the ScipyMinimizeSolver interfaces.

### Planar IDK

The `planar_idk.py` script contains a simple example of a possible Inverse Differential Kinematics (IDK) implementation for a planar three DoF robot arm.
The task-space consists of a desired displacement of the x and y position of the end-effector and the IDK computes the optimal set of joint angle displacements, using two different alternative Quadratic Program (QP) solvers.
This formulation also adds bounds to the end-effector orientation and compares the result with the solution obtained through the pseudo-inverse approach.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1

Assuming PyBullet is installed, this experiment should run out of the box.

### Experiment 2

This experiment requires some additional setup to run.
Ultimately, it requires [TracIK](https://traclabs.com/projects/trac-ik/) and [EXOTica](https://github.com/ipab-slmc/exotica).
The easiest way to install these and run the experiment is to follow these instructions.

1. [Install ROS Noetic (full install)](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
2. [Install catkin_tools](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
3. Create catkin workspace and `src` directory: `$ mkdir -p optas_expr_ws/src && cd optas_expr_ws`
4. Initialize catkin workspace: `$ catkin init`
5. Change directory: `$ cd src`
6. Clone EXOTica: `$ git clone git@github.com:ipab-slmc/exotica.git`
7. Clone TracIK: `$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/traclabs/trac_ik.git`
8. Install dependencies: `$ rosdep update ; rosdep install --from-paths ./ -iry`
9. Build catkin workspace: `$ catkin build`
10. Source catkin workspace: `$ source ../devel/setup.bash`
11. Change directory: `$ cd /path/to/optas/example`
12. Run experiment: `$ python experiment2.py` (**note**: since EXOTica loads URDF/SRDF files using relative filenames to where the load methods are called, you must ensure to run this script from inside the `example/` directory - this doesn't apply for the other examples)
